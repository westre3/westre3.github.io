<p>My name is Robert West, but my friends call me Trey. I'm currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Virginia (UVA), but I'm looking to move away from academia. While at UVA, I've studied computer architecture from a thermal perspective by working on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.github.com/uvahotspot/HotSpot.git">HotSpot</a>, a pre-RTL thermal simulator. I'm passionate about computer engineering in general, and about software engineering and algorithms in particular. I find the complexity of modern computers fascinating, especially because we can harness that complexity to solve hard problems.</p>

<p>I've spent most of my time at UVA developing HotSpot, but I've also worked on some interesting <a href="/projects.html">projects</a> in my free time. Furthermore, I've been a graduate TA for both Computer Engineering and Data Structures and Algorithms courses at UVA. I'm particularly proud of my work in the second course because I got to be a TA during the very first semester that UVA offered it (Spring 2020) and received an outstanding TA award from the Computer Science department for my work!</p>

<p>In my free time, I love to read fantasy novels. Some of my favorites include <a target="_blank" href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/the-mistborn-saga-the-original-trilogy/">The Mistborn<sup>&#174</sup> Saga</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/the-stormlight-archive-series/">The Stormmlight Archive<sup>&#174</sup></a> by Brandon Sanderson, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.patrickrothfuss.com/content/books.asp">The Kingkiller Chronicle</a> by Patrick Rothfuss, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/43531-gentleman-bastard">Gentleman Bastard Series</a> by Scott Lynch.</p>
